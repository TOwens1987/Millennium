Millennium Battery Express is a disabled veteran owned small business. The owner, John Farrell started in the battery industry working for Charleston Battery. He was their salesman who grew the business with hard work and persistence. This company would eventually be bought by Interstate Batteries where John was quickly moved to the Regional Sales position. John has sold batteries throughout the entire southeast. After doing this for years he approached Interstate with the idea of opening a battery store in Moncks Corner, South Carolina. They said they didn't think it would work. John was tired of being on the road all the time and away from his family. He resigned Interstate Batteries and started his own business. Millennium Battery Express was established in 2003 and has grown from humble beginnings. Millennium Battery is proof that hardwork and perseverance pay off. Millennium Battery is the fast growing battery company in the Charleston area. John's favorite saying is "The best ability is dependability!" and Millennium Battery has the batteries to back up this quote.
